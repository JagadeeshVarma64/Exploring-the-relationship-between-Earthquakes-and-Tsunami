# Exploring the relationship between Earthquakes and Tsunami

# Project Description:


The goal of this research is to look into the relationship between the magnitude of the earthquake and the intensity of the tsunami that might show up after that. Tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, if the earthquake disturbs the surface water of the ocean. we can easily think that stronger earthquakes cause tsunamis to be more severe, but more research is needed to fully understand this relationship. This research aims to find out whether there is a direct relationship between the magnitude of the earthquake and the severity of following tsunamis by looking at the previous data on earthquakes and tsunamis.

# System Requirements:

Big Data Platform: DataBricks - A Big data platform used for analysis and machine learning.

Tools: Spark with python(PySpark) Used for analysis and Data processing And Spark MLlib Used for Random forest, Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

# How to Run:

Before setting up and running the system we need the following requirements:

Internet to access Databricks and Web browser(chorme,Safari,etc.)

Step 1: Set up Databricks

1) Create Databricks account:

Visit Databricks and sign up with Databricks Community Edition and follow the instructions to set up.


2) Create Workspace:

Once you done with setup Create a Workspace.

Step 2: Working on Databricks

1) Create a cluster: Go to compute and give the name to that compute and select 14.3 LTS ML(Recommended)

2) Install all the Required libraries such as pyspark, Spark MLlib, pandas, Folium, branca, matplotlib and seaborn.

Step 3: Evaluating Notebooks.

1) Initially create new notebook in your workspace.

2) Now open the existing notebook file by uploading the file within new notebook file.

3) Finally Run all the cells from that notebook file to get the results.

Step 4: just Copy and paste the entire "AIT614-005-FInalproject-TEAM6_Geospacial analysis(Foliummap).py"

1) Open a fresh notebook and copy the entire code(AiT614-005-FInalproject-TEAM6_Geospacial analysis(Foliummap).py) in the new notebook

NOTE: Since it is folium map(Large in size) we are unable to download the html & notebook file from the databricks so we are sharing the Source code Using that cod eit can be runned.
